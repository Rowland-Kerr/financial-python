# Financial Python Projects

This repository showcases a collection of my quantitative finance and algorithmic problem-solving projects, written in Python.  
Each project focuses on a key aspect of mathematical finance, data analysis, or computational problem-solving, built to demonstrate both technical rigour and clear communication.


## Contents

### Linear Regression Signal Model and Backtest
[`/linear_regression_backtest`](./linear_regression_backtest)
- Uses OLS regression (`statsmodels`) on nine global equity indices to identify predictive signals.  
- Includes train/test split, Sharpe ratio and drawdown evaluation.  
- Demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and honest assessment of model performance under market regime change.


### Black‚ÄìScholes Option Pricing and Sensitivity Analysis
[`/black_scholes_model`](./black_scholes_model)
- Implements closed-form pricing for European call and put options.  
- Includes functions for Greeks (Œî, Œì, Œò, œÅ, ŒΩ) and visualisation of sensitivities.  
- Demonstrates practical use of `NumPy`, `SciPy`, and `Matplotlib` for quantitative modelling.


### Dynamic Programming Algorithms (Leetcode)
[`/dynamic_programming`](./dynamic_programming)
- A set of concise, well-commented solutions to classic dynamic programming problems.  
- Each file includes the original problem statement and Python implementation with explanation.  
- Demonstrates algorithmic reasoning, optimisation, and clean code structure.


### Problem Solving (Leetcode)
[`/problem_solving_(leetcode)`](./problem_solving_(leetcode))
- Miscellaneous algorithmic challenges focusing on data structures and logical reasoning.  
- Serves as a record of my continued coding practice and technical interview preparation.


## Libraries and Tools

`Python`, `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `SciPy`, `Statsmodels`, `yfinance`, `os`


## Motivation

This repository reflects my ongoing learning and independent research in **quantitative finance**.  
I am particularly interested in:

- Statistical modelling of financial time-series  
- Option pricing and risk sensitivities  
- Portfolio optimisation and robustness testing  
- Algorithmic reasoning and computational efficiency  

My goal is to develop transparent, well-documented code that can stand up to critical scrutiny ‚Äî both mathematically and practically.


## About Me

Oxford Physics graduate and former University Chess Captain, currently developing advanced programming and quantitative skills for a career in **quantitative finance**.

## Notes on Repository Organisation

- Each project folder has its own `README.md` describing objectives, methods, and key results.  
- Code is modular and reproducible; results can be replicated by running the scripts sequentially.  
- Visual outputs (plots, metrics tables) are stored in each folder as `.png` or `.csv` files.
